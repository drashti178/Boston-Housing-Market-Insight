# Boston-Housing-Market-Insight
Python project for data analysis

This project is included in IBM Course for data science.

This project provides a statistical analysis of housing prices in Boston, MA, using historical data derived from the U.S. Census Service. The goal is to extract actionable insights for upper management and policymakers to support informed decision-making in urban planning, housing affordability, and neighborhood development.

Key aspects of the analysis include:

- Understanding how various factors (e.g., crime rate, accessibility to highways, pupil-teacher ratio, and proximity to the Charles River) affect home values.

- Discretization of continuous variables (e.g., age of buildings) for categorical comparisons.

- Regression modeling to identify the most influential predictors of median home value.

- Visualization tools (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots) for interpreting the data distribution and relationships.

- Summary statistics and hypothesis testing to assess statistical significance.
